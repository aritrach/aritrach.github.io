Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a graduate student in the <a href='https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/'>Electrical, Computer & Energy Engineering Department</a> at the University of Colorado Boulder. I take many courses related to AI and Robotics, as I find the world of autonomous systems truly fascinating!

Previously, I worked in various system verification and validation roles at APTIV, focusing on L2+ Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Michigan.

My passion lies at the intersection of AI and robotics, where I aim to work with intelligent systems that enhance autonomous capabilities. During my master's, I've worked on multiple projects, including using ROS2 for autonomous controls, applying basic machine learning to healthcare applications, and employing reinforcement learning and advanced techniques for decision-making under uncertainty.

I enjoy learning about AI, working on personal projects, and expanding my understanding of the CS world. In my free time, I like to go to the gym and spend time with my family and friends.
